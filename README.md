> silence
/ˈsʌɪləns/

### Scenario 1

You have posted a question on a mailing list, and you are sure based
on your past experience that people would generally be detail oriented
to see your complete message. But, no one responds back, everyone just
stays silent. You say to yourself why don't somebody just say yes or
no. It is not as simple as that. This is where the subtle answer is
given in the form of silence.

> So, depending on your question the answer is obvious.


### Scenario 2

You have given your resume to a friend in the hopes of getting
referred to where they are working. You tried to reach them at regular
intervals in a reasonable timeframe and you are not consistently
receiving any feedback, then the answer is obvious. That they might
have tried well enough, or they are too busy with their work. Hence
they cannot respond back.


> So, on safe side the response would be negative and you need to move on.
